# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning models, based on various features such as size, location, and amenities. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging libraries like **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **matplotlib**.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Handles missing values and feature scaling.
- Model training: Includes regression models (e.g., Linear Regression).
- Evaluation: Measures accuracy using metrics like RMSE.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the notebook:  
   Open `house_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute cells step-by-step.

## Files
- `house_prediction.ipynb`: Core implementation of the prediction model.
- `data.csv`: Input dataset (replace with your own data if required).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Improve feature engineering.
